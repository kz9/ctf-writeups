# In Hex, No One Can Hear You Complain

* Problem:

  While flying through the outskirts of the Ripley system, you notice a distress signal from one of the outer moons. It appears a ship has crash-landed near a 16-sided pyramid. The lone survivor, a docx file, tells you that a malicious programmer has embedded an egg in his chest and he's afraid that it's going to hatch. He offers his assistance if you can help find the egg.

* Solution:

  We open the .docx file, in there it says there is a hidden image in this file. Also zipped is highlighted. Hence we get the idea to open .docx as a zip file(The header `50 4B 03 04` also suggested zip for the first two bytes) In ubuntu, we can use archive manager to open it, locate to media, and we found the key.png
