# Classic

* Problem:

  Someone or something stuck a random flyer on your space ship that reads:

    `cslcehesehft ohrumvc zmvm scmk ht ptohmte ehbmc mxmt eufsju eumq pvm dshem mpchgq lvfymt zheu nsce p rmtohg ptk rprmv, fv bfvm vmomtegq lq ofbbft ofbrsemvhwmk effgc. qfsv ymq hc: zumt_kf_zm_jme_ef_eum_upvk_cesii`

* Solution:
  
  Since it says classic, the first thing pops out of my head is a substitution cipher. Using this [solver](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver.php) We can easily get the answer

* Answer:

  when_do_we_get_to_the_hard_stuff

  (Although the website given above solves the cipher, but it ignores the underline and the answer should be lower cased)
