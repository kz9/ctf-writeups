# Pilot Logic

* Problem:

  You've gotten a partial dump of the disk from the hangar's machine, and you're pretty sure the pilot's password is cleverly hidden somewhere within it...
The disk image can be found on the shell machines at `/problems/pilot_logic.img` and the contents of the image are available in `/problems/pilot_logic/`

* Solution:

  ssh into the shell for the game
go to `/problems/pilot_logic/`
cd into `home/pilotbot`
`ls -a` in the directory to show hidden directory
`cd .secret`
`cat key`

* Answer:

  You can't take the sky from me
